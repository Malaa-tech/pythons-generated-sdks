  setup-machine:
    desc: "Setting up local machine with all dependencies needed such as brew"
    summary: |
      This task will setup local machine with all dependencies needed such as brew
    cmds:
      - chmod +x ./scripts/setup-machine.sh
      - ./scripts/setup-machine.sh

  start-cluster:
    desc: "Starting local k8s cluster"
    summary: |
      This task will start kubernetes local cluster which will host all of our deployments (containers for simplicity),
      notes:
      - For now we are only using Minikube as an option
      - If you did 'docker ps', and saw only 1 container running that's fine,
        it's the Minikube VM and all containers deployed inside it
    cmds:
      - minikube start # Start Minikube if it's not already running
      - eval $(minikube docker-env) # Use Minikube's Docker daemon

  run:
    desc: "Running Malaa's backend services"
    cmds:
      - skaffold dev --wait-for-deletions=false --verbosity=debug --port-forward   # Deploy with Skaffold

    aliases: ["docker-prune"]
    desc: "Removing not used resources"
    summary: |
      Automatically removes all resources not associated with a container.
      This is a quick way to get rid of old Docker images, containers, volumes, and networks
    cmds:

    summary: |

    deps:
      - sh -c "read -p 'Are you sure you want to remove all dependencies that has been installed? (y/n) ' -n 1 -r; echo; if [[ ! \$REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then exit 1; fi"
    cmds:
      - minikube delete # Delete Minikube cluster
      - rm -rf ~/.minikube # Delete Minikube local configuration
      - rm -rf ~/.kube # Delete Kubernetes local configuration
      - rm -rf ~/.helm # Delete Helm local configuration
      - rm -rf ~/.docker # Delete Docker local configuration
